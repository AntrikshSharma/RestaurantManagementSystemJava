# Restaurant Management System Using Java

Our restaurant management software is designed specifically to help users manage their food service establishment. It would help restaurant owners and managers run a restaurant end to end. We are creating this software to help them keep a track of inventory, orders, accounting and analytics and ease the onboarding process for new employees.
To summarise, the software focuses on the behind-the-scene processes of a restaurant.
